			<h2>The Challenge We Solve</h2>
			<div class="service-card">
				<p style="font-size:17px; margin-bottom:20px; color:var(--text-light);">There are hundreds of Audiology and hearing aid centers all over Kerala who all dispense various brands of hearing aids which are, mostly European and west-based companies, and the distributors are all based in metro cities like Delhi, Mumbai and Bengaluru.</p>
				
				<p style="margin-bottom:20px;">In the business there is a vital necessity of technical after-sale support, and this has to be given by the company which is not there in Kerala.</p>
				
				<p style="margin-bottom:20px;"><strong>The centers sent the hearing aid collected from customers for service to the above cities. It takes minimum 8–10 days to get serviced and send back.</strong></p>
